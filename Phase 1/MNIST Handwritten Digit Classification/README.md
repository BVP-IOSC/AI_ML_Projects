# MNIST-Digit-Classification
##### ABOUT: The project is based on python using machine learning libraries that are sklearn, matplotlib. MNIST digit classification identifies number digits handwritten by the user. The MNIST dataset was taken from kaggle (Link given below)

##### CONTENT DESCRIPTION : 
- main.py and main.py.ipynb are the implementation of all the ML models that are used for classification problem to check which model gives the best accuracy for the MNIST dataset, gui.py is the graphical interface using SVM rbf model.
- runtime of gui.py : 3.25 minutes

##### RESOURCES :
Dataset taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?datasetId=27352&searchQuery=svm

#### NOTE : change the file locations of icon mnist_train and mnist_test to the location in your machine before executing the main.py and gui.py
